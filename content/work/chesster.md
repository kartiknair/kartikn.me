My most recent project was reworking Chesster's brand identity. The guuys over at Chesster approached me a few weeks ago looking for a fresh new identity for their amazing non-profit. We worked together for a couple of weeks before arriving at this. I'm pretty proud of the end result, even though the logo is not the best or the most creative idea (the knight idea is pretty overdone) I was happy about how cohesive the entire branding turned out with a very distinct idea.
